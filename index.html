      <strong><em>Why Coding?</em></strong>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      I have always enjoyed math. In high school, geometry was my favorite math class. I enjoyed the process of having to prove the logic. In college, it was discrete math. I enjoyed the process of the proofs from start to finish and how interconnected they were. It made me question the why and how it works; everyone's favorite question when their code isn't working. Sometimes, it is frustrating trying to add in or change code but the feeling of accomplishment afterwards always triumps the frustration. Coding is an endless cycle of frustration, learning, and then triumph because there is always something else to add, fix, or change. This is why I choose to code, to learn and solve problems as they arise alongside a team that has the same goal in mind.

      <strong><em>What I've been up to...</em></strong>

      Hi, I'm Rose Hughes. I am currently working on a Zero to Mastery Compelete Web Developer course on Udemy. I am also taking a Microsoft SQL course to refresh and improve my SQL. I have completed an internship that focused three months on backend and three months on frontend. I graduated with my Bachelors in Computer Science from St. Cloud State University. While I was in college, I was a Teacher's Assistant for several Computer Science courses and worked part-time as an Administrative Assistant at NorthStar Media. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I also enjoy hiking and reading.

      I am open to  backend or a full stack developer position.
