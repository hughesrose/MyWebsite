      Why Coding? 
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      I have always enjoyed math. In highschool, geometry was my favorite math class. I enjoyed the process of having to prove the logic. In college, it was discrete math. I enjoyed the process of the proofs from start to finish and how interconnected they were. It made me questions the why and how it works; everyones favorite question when their code isn't working. Sometimes, it is frusturating trying to add in or change code but the feeling of accomplishment afterwards always triumps the frustration. Coding is an endless cycle of frustration, learing, and then triump because there is always something else to add, fix, or change. That is why I choose to code, to learn and solve problems as they arise alongside a team that has the same goal in mind.
